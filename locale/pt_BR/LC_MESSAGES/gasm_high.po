"Note that the value of the variable do not really intervene because of the "

"variable which will not be used. Note also that two other possible "
"expressions for exactly the same result for the assembly string are "
"``\"Grad_Test2_u.Grad_Test_u\"`` (i.e. an order 2 expression) or "
"``\"Norm_sqr(Grad_u)/2\"`` (i.e. a potential). In fact other possible "

" ``\"[Grad_u(1), Grad_u(2)].[Grad_Test_u(1), Grad_Test_u(2)]\"`` for two-"

"order 1 expression (weak formulation) if there is no particular reason to "
